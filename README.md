# ShivaNata
Basic Code underpinning for Shiva Nata movements

This is an example of how to implement Shiva Nata  Operations into Kotlin (Java) functions.
The data is held in a class ShivaPosition which has Int values to describe the position of each arm, the leg position and the leg mode. No code has been implemented for the leg mode at this stage.

Each function takes a ShivaPosition as an input and returns a ShivaPosition.
At this point all functions take work using a combination of addition and the "bitwise and" function which works like a specialised modulus. It would be fairly easy to combine all of this functionality into a single function which would be the next step of development.

Source code is located in the src folder.
